# oilfield_accidents_data_analysis_project
Personal project being developed when I have extra time. Below will be a very rough description of my plans for the project though this description will evlove as the project is developed.

I am taking a dataset from kaggle based on oilfield accident data in the US and doing some data analysis by using queries and data visualization tool such as PowerBI. Data dates range from 2010 to 2017.

First, I aim to clean the data and create a new database to store it as well as normailze it to 3NF. I will be doing this using DBeaver as my database tool and all coding with be done is Postgresql when using this tool.

Second, I plan on performing queries on the data to find useful insights. I will also be learning PowerBI from the Microsoft PL-900 certificate training course to then apply this knowledge to the project for data visualization.

Finaly, I will be compiling all this information into a report that I hope to present some intresting findings in.
